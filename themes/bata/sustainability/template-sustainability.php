										Bata’s heritage lies in our global manufacturing. We continue to manufacture shoes in our own production facilities in 24 factories in 18 countries. Certain processes, such as stitching uppers, are outsourced to closely linked local businesses, known as Associate Business Units (ABUs). We also work with suppliers in Europe and Asia who manufacture shoes and accessory products on our behalf.
